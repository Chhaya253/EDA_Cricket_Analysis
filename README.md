# Cricket Analysis – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## Project Overview

This project performs **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on cricket match data to uncover patterns, trends, and insights related to team performance, players, venues, and match outcomes. The analysis focuses on understanding the data through statistics and visualizations rather than building predictive models.

## Objectives

* Clean and preprocess raw cricket data
* Analyze match and player performance trends
* Identify key factors influencing match outcomes
* Visualize insights using plots and charts

## Dataset

* Source: Public cricket dataset (CSV format)
* Contents may include: matches, teams, players, venues, runs, wickets, seasons, and results

## Tools & Technologies

* **Python**
* **Pandas** – data manipulation
* **NumPy** – numerical operations
* **Matplotlib / Seaborn** – data visualization
* **Jupyter Notebook** – analysis environment

## EDA Workflow

1. Data loading and inspection
2. Data cleaning (handling missing values, duplicates)
3. Feature understanding and transformation
4. Univariate and bivariate analysis
5. Visualization of trends and patterns
6. Key insights and observations

## Key Analysis Areas

* Team-wise performance comparison
* Player statistics analysis
* Venue-wise trends
* Match outcome distribution
* Season-wise analysis

## Sample Visualizations

* Bar charts for team wins
* Line plots for season trends
* Histograms for score distributions
* Heatmaps for correlations

## Results & Insights

* Identified consistently high-performing teams and players
* Observed venue-specific advantages
* Found trends across seasons and match formats

## Key Findings

* Certain teams show consistently higher win percentages across multiple seasons
* Home venues provide a noticeable advantage to hosting teams
* Top-order batsmen contribute a major share of total runs scored
* Matches with early wicket losses tend to have lower total scores
* Some venues favor bowlers, resulting in low-scoring matches
* Seasonal analysis reveals changes in team dominance over time

## How to Run

1. Clone or download the repository
2. Install required libraries:

   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
   ```
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
4. Run `EDAProj.ipynb`
